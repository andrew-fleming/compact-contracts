/**
 * Composition root for the live backend. Runs once per worker before the unit
 * specs when `test:live` is used (on the dry path this file is not loaded).
 *
 * It owns the wiring — everything else is split by responsibility:
 *   - {@link WalletPool} builds the pooled wallets (testkit-free orchestration).
 *   - {@link FundedWallet} builds one dust-funded wallet from a seed.
 *   - {@link fundFromDeployer} tops up a signer the dev preset didn't fund.
 *   - {@link LiveSimulatorBackend} deploys per `Sim.create()` and assembles the
 *     simulator `LiveContext`.
 *
 * Each vitest worker drives a disjoint wallet partition keyed on its
 * `VITEST_POOL_ID` (see {@link walletSeedsFor}), so parallel `unit-live` files
 * never share a wallet's UTXOs. Every worker's deployer is a genesis-funded
 * seed; its three signers start empty and are topped up from it before the
 * pool's readiness gate.
 *
 * Order matters: pin the process network id first (deployContract and the
 * indexer provider read it globally), register the backend, then build the
 * wallets up front so specs can read each published `MIDNIGHT_<ALIAS>_COIN_PK`
 * at module load (e.g. a forwarder's parent key, or a multisig's live signer
 * set). Top-level await; setup files are awaited before test files.
