/**
 * Deployer-funds-signer top-up for the local `undeployed` devnet.
 *
 * Each worker's three signers are derived seeds the dev preset never funds, so
 * they start with zero NIGHT and cannot pay tx fees. This transfers NIGHT from
 * the worker's (genesis-funded) deployer to a signer, registers it for dust
 * generation, and waits for the dust to appear — after which the signer can pay
 * for its own multisig transactions. Verified end-to-end on the live stack: dust
 * bootstraps within one block of the registration. On-chain funding persists, so
 * only the first spec file per worker pays the top-up; later files skip it.
 *
 * Only the testkit-aware layer uses this; the pool and its unit tests stay
 * testkit-free (the funder is wired in by `live.setup.ts`).
