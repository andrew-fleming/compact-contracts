/**
 * Asserting *why* a call was rejected, on either backend.
 *
 * `expect(...).rejects.toThrow(msg)` reads `error.message` and nothing else.
 * That is enough when the failure comes from an in-circuit `assert`, whose text
 * the compiler emits into the circuit. It is not enough when the failure comes
 * from a witness throwing: on the live backend that arrives wrapped twice,
 *
 *   Error            "Unexpected error executing scoped transaction '…': …"
 *     cause: ContractRuntimeError  "Error executing circuit 'transfer'"
 *       cause:                     the witness's own error
 *
 * so the real reason sits below the surface and a message assertion that passes
 * dry fails live for no behavioural reason. Both wrappers do preserve `cause`
 * (`midnight-js-contracts` uses `new Error(msg, { cause: err })`, and
 * `compact-js`'s `ContractRuntimeError.make(message, cause)` keeps it), so the
 * reason is still there — just not where vitest looks.
 *
 * {@link expectRejection} walks the whole chain, so one assertion string holds
 * in both backends: dry matches at depth 0, live further down.
 *
 * Effect hides a failure's cause behind a `FiberFailure` that only renders via
 * `toString()`, and an `AggregateError` keeps its children on `errors`, so the
 * walk covers both alongside `cause`.
