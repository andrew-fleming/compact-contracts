/**
 * A {@link ConcurrencyHarness} that replays transcripts in memory.

 * Not an approximation of the node: `QueryContext.runTranscript` is the same
 * verifying-mode entry point in the same WASM onchain runtime the node runs, so
 * a rejection here is the rejection the node would issue for the same reason.
 *
 * SCOPE. `run_transcript` forwards the program and the gas budget to `query` and
 * ignores `transcript.effects` (onchain-runtime/src/context.rs:990), so this
 * covers exactly ONE of the two couplings between a transcript and its
 * snapshot: pinned reads. The declared-vs-recomputed effects check runs in the
 * ledger after the transcript does (ledger/src/semantics.rs:1400), as do mempool
 * ordering, block inclusion, and fee treatment on a failed segment. All of those
 * are live-backend properties.
