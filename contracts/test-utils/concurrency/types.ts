/**
 * The vocabulary a concurrency spec writes against, shared by every backend.
 *
 * A Compact transaction does not carry "call this circuit with these
 * arguments". It carries a fixed public transcript, an Impact program built
 * against the state the wallet saw, which the node re-executes against whatever
 * state is current when the transaction lands. Two things tie that transcript
 * to the state it was built on:
 *
 *   1. every ledger read the circuit consumed is a `popeq` with the expected
 *      value baked in, so a divergent read is a hard rejection,
 *   2. the declared effects must equal the ones the replay recomputes.
 *
 * So a conflict is not a race in wall-clock time. It is a divergence between
 * the state a transcript was built on and the state it is applied to, which is
 * why {@link ConcurrencyHarness} separates `build` from `land`: a spec pins two
 * builds to one snapshot, then applies them in order. No same-block trickery on
 * either backend.
 *
 * Which of the two couplings a backend can see differs, so a claim that depends
 * on (2) belongs in a live spec. See the SCOPE note on `DryReplayHarness`.
