/**
 * @description Test helpers for inspecting the Zswap inputs (coin spends /
 * nullifiers) and outputs (coin commitments) a circuit produces in the
 * simulator.
 *
 * The dry (in-memory) simulator does NOT enforce the ledger's nullifier set,
 * so it will happily let a circuit spend the same coin twice — a node would
 * reject that as a double spend. But the simulator DOES record every spend and
 * every created coin in the circuit's Zswap local state. Reading that lets a
 * unit test catch a whole class of coin-handling bugs without a node:
 * in particular, a circuit that emits a change coin, immediately re-spends it
 * (revealing its nullifier), and then persists/returns that same coin as if it
 * were still spendable. See the `ShieldedTreasury` / `ForwarderPrivate`
 * "change coin is spendable" tests.
