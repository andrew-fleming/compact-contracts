/**
 * @module ZOwnablePK
 * @description A shielded, public key-derived Ownable module.
 *
 * `ZOwnablePK` provides a privacy-preserving access control mechanism
 * for contracts with a single administrative user. Unlike traditional
 * `Ownable` implementations that store or expose the owner's public key
 * on-chain, this module stores only a commitment to a hashed identifier
 * derived from the owner's public key and a secret nonce.
 * For the strongest security guarantees, use an Air-Gapped Public Key.
 *
 * @notice This module explicitly supports commitments derived from public keys;
 * however, it may be possible to use contract addresses when contract-to-contract
 * calls become available. This will be revisited when it's known if/how witnesses
 * are used from a contract address context.
 *
 * @dev Features:
 * - Obfuscated owner identity: The owner's public key is never revealed on-chain.
 * - Stateless verification: The contract never needs access to the full public key.
 * - Built-in support for transfer and renounce functionality.
 * - Instance-specific salts to prevent cross-contract correlation.
 * - Deterministic hashing with `persistentHash` to support zero-knowledge verification.
 *
 * @dev Commitment structure:
 * ```
 * id = SHA256(pk, secretNonce)
 * commitment = SHA256(id, instanceSalt, counter, "ZOwnablePK:shield:")
 * ```
 * The commitment changes on each transfer due to the incrementing `counter`,
 * providing unlinkability across ownership changes.
 *
 * @dev Security Considerations:
 * - The `secretNonce` must be kept private. Loss of the nonce prevents the
 *   owner from proving ownership or transferring it.
 * - Ownership validation is entirely circuit-based using witness-provided values.
 * - The `_instanceSalt` is immutable and used to differentiate deployments.
 *
 * @notice Best used for single-admin contracts with privacy requirements.
 * It is not designed for multi-owner or role-based access control.
