/**
 * Concurrency claims for the ConfidentialNoteFungibleToken core.
 *
 * Whether a call still lands once someone else's call moved the ledger first.
 *
 * Every case builds two calls against one snapshot, lands the first, then applies
 * the second. See `#test-utils/concurrency/types.ts` for why that reproduces a
 * real conflict deterministically, with no race to lose.
 *
 * EXHAUSTIVE, NOT SAMPLED. Five callable operations give 25 ordered pairs, doubled
 * for spend-vs-spend which splits on whether both spend the same note. Enumerating
 * a space that small beats sampling it. Each case asserts against {@link predict}
 * rather than a memorised answer, so a new circuit with unexpected pinning fails
 * here instead of silently widening the gap between model and module.
 *
 * What each operation pins:
 *
 *   `_mint` / `_mintNote`   read `_issuedNonces.member(tag)`, pinning that ONE
 *                           key, then insert into `_commitments` at the LIVE
 *                           first-free index. Distinct nonces commute.
 *   `transfer` / `burn` /   read `_nullifiers.member(nf)`, pinning that ONE key,
 *   `_consumeNote`          and `checkRoot(root)`, which on a HistoricMerkleTree
 *                           pins "in history" and survives concurrent inserts.
 *
 * Two pinned key spaces, so the matrix holds one of them still: every call below
 * emits a nonce nobody else emits, which isolates the nullifier axis. The mint
 * axis gets its own describe at the foot of the file.
 *
 * `_mint` x `transfer` is the load-bearing row: swap `HistoricMerkleTree` for
 * `MerkleTree` and it fails, since plain `checkRoot` pins the CURRENT root. Nothing
 * else notices that one-word change, so keep that row if this matrix is trimmed.
