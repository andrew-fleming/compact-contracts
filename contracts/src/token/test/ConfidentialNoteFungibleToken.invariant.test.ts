/**
 * Stateful invariants of the note core, over generated operation sequences.
 *
 * Neither the functional nor the property suite says anything about a SEQUENCE:
 * that after any interleaving of mint, transfer, and burn, the ledger still agrees
 * with what a wallet believes. So this carries a shadow model of an honest wallet
 * and re-checks it after every step.
 *
 * Conservation is checked per operation, not globally, since the core keeps no
 * supply figure: `transfer` splits the input exactly, `burn` destroys exactly what
 * it was asked to.
 *
 * DRY ONLY. Each operation is a transaction on live, so 20 runs of 6 would be some
 * 120 txs and 90 minutes. Fuzzing is a dry technique here; live covers the same
 * circuits by example.
