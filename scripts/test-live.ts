/**
 * Live-test orchestrator entry point: resolve args into a plan, wire the
 * services, run it under the single-run lock, always stop the stack.
 *
 * Each concern lives in `scripts/live/` with the reasoning that belongs to it:
 *   - `targets.ts`          — what an invocation resolves to (pure)
 *   - `RunLock.ts`          — one orchestrator run at a time
 *   - `LiveStack.ts`        — `make env-up` / `env-down` lifecycle
 *   - `ArtifactCompiler.ts` — build + truncated-ZK-key self-heal
 *   - `VitestRunner.ts`     — spawn one live project, read its JSON report
 *   - `LiveOrchestrator.ts` — the two rounds and flake classification
 *   - `Reporter.ts`         — verdict, CI annotations, job summary
 *   - `shell.ts` / `paths.ts` — process, console and filesystem primitives
 *
 * Why a script and not turbo tasks: turbo models a DAG of stateless, cacheable
 * tasks, and a live run needs stateful orchestration a task graph cannot express:
 *   - two-round flake classification (re-run failures, classify, exit 0 on
 *     flaky-only);
 *   - docker lifecycle between targets and rounds against ONE shared node —
 *     parallel turbo tasks would race over it;
 *   - ZK-key integrity self-heal (turbo's own poisoned cache, #675);
 *   - infra-vs-test exit codes (2 vs 1), the pid lock, CI verdict summaries.
 * Turbo still runs where the DAG helps: the compile and harness-smoke steps go
 * through it (cached keygen, dependency ordering).
 *
 * Usage (via the root package.json scripts):
 *   yarn test:live                     # every live-ready category
 *   yarn test:live multisig            # one category
 *   yarn test:live multisig Forwarder  # files within a category
 *   yarn test:live integration         # the composed-contract integration specs
 *   yarn test:live --list              # live targets, for the CI matrix (JSON)
 *
 * The stack's whole lifecycle belongs to this script: it starts it (`make env-up`,
 * itself a reset) and stops it on every exit path, signals included.
 * `MIDNIGHT_LIVE_KEEP_ENV=1` leaves it running for post-mortem inspection;
 * container logs in `logs/` survive teardown either way.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 pass (flaky-only included), 1 real test failure, 2 infrastructure
 * abort, 130/143 interrupted.
 *
 * Node runs this .ts directly (type stripping); only `node:` builtins.
