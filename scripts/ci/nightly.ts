 * run. One issue, not one per night, so the history of a flaky stretch stays in
 * one thread.
 *
 * The decision ({@link nightlyAction}) is pure and exhaustively tested; the GitHub
 * side of it is an {@link IssueTracker} the caller supplies (`gh.ts` in CI, a
 * recorder in the tests).

 *   - one `failure` anywhere is a failed nightly, however many targets passed;
 *   - `cancelled` is not a verdict, so it only wins when nothing failed;
 *   - a mix of `success` and `skipped` is a success, because a run scoped to one
