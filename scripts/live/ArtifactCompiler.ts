/**
 * Builds the artifacts a live run will deploy, and refuses to hand the run a
 * poisoned artifact tree.
 *
 * The scope says what to build and what to check: a scoped run compiles its own
 * slice (`compile:<category>`, with turbo pulling in the categories it imports)
 * instead of the whole repo, which is what keeps a CI job for one target from
 * paying for every other target's key generation. See `compileScope` in
 * `targets.ts` for how a plan resolves to one.
 *
 * A killed compile (or machine crash) can poison the turbo cache so every later
 * cache hit re-extracts a truncated key, and a concurrent compile racing over the
 * shared `artifacts/` tree can truncate keys directly
 * (OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts#675). A 0-byte `.prover` makes the deploy fail
 * in `beforeAll`, which vitest turns into a silent whole-suite skip — the failure
 * mode this check exists to prevent. Both repairs are mechanical, so self-heal
 * once (drain the cache, recompile serially — a parallel recompile can re-poison
 * it) and only abort if keys are still truncated afterwards.
 *
 * In `prebuilt` mode the tree was built somewhere else and arrives ready — a CI
 * compile job builds it once and every suite job for that target downloads it.
 * Building is then the wrong response to a bad tree: the artifacts are an input
 * to this run, not its product, so a failure aborts instead of quietly
 * recompiling in every one of the jobs that share them.
