 * What a live invocation resolves to.

 * A target is either a unit category (`src/<category>`, run under
 * `--project unit-live`) or the composed-contract `integration` target (run under
 * `--project integration-live` over `test/integration/specs`).
 *
 * Exactly ONE live project per vitest invocation: both live projects derive their
 * wallets from `walletSeedsFor(VITEST_POOL_ID)`, so worker 1 of each resolves to
 * the same genesis deployer. `live.globalSetup` rejects a second live project in
 * one process; issuing one `--project` per invocation is how this side keeps that
 * from happening in the first place.
