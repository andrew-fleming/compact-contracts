/**
 * Failures a fresh node cannot change the verdict on.
 *
 * The two-round design exists because the live specs share one node: a file
 * that failed in a busy round 1 may pass alone on a reset stack, which is what
 * round 2 tests. But some failures are properties of the transaction itself,
 * not of the node's state — re-running them on a fresh node returns the exact
 * same rejection, so round 2 only doubles the loss (measured on run
 * 32831811290: 11 legs, every one a known-deterministic rejection, each paying
 * a second stack reset and re-run for nothing).
 *
 * A file skips round 2 only when EVERY failed test in it matches one of these
 * patterns through a thrown error (a matcher failure quotes its expected value,
 * so it never counts); a single unmatched (or message-less) failure keeps the
 * file on today's round-2 path, so an unknown failure can never lose its flake
 * check.
