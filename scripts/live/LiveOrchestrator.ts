/**
 * Runs the two-round live verification.
 *
 * The live specs are not isolated from one another: they all run against one
 * shared node, so state left by an earlier test can make a later one fail (a coin
 * re-spent against stale node state is rejected with node "Custom error: 103").
 * A file that fails during a busy full run may therefore pass in isolation on a
 * fresh node. Hence two rounds:
 *
 *   Round 1: compile + harness smoke once, then per target: reset the stack and
 *            run that target's files (parallel workers where the project allows
 *            it). Collect the files that failed from the JSON reporter.
 *   Round 2: for each failed file, reset the stack and re-run just that file on
 *            its own (one worker), so no earlier round-2 file can dirty the node
 *            under a later one. A file whose every round-1 failure matches a
 *            deterministic rejection (`deterministic.ts`) is exempt: a fresh
 *            node returns the same verdict, so it reports REAL immediately with
 *            the cause named.
 *
 * A file that fails round 1 but passes round 2 is FLAKY (an environment
 * artifact); one that fails both — or never reports in round 2 — is a REAL
 * failure. The run exits 0 unless there is a real failure, so an env flake never
 * turns the build red, but it is reported loudly.
 *
 * Anything that prevents classification (no report written, a non-zero exit with
 * no failing files, a run that matched no test file at all, a stack that will not
 * come up) aborts with {@link INFRA_ABORT} rather than being guessed at.
