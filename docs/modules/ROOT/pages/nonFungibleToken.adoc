= NonFungibleToken

FungibleToken is a specification for {non-fungible-tokens},
a type of token where all the units are unique and distinct from each other.
This module is an approximation of {eip-721} written in the Compact programming language for the Midnight network.

== ERC721 Compatbility

Even though Midnight is not EVM-compatible, this implementation attempts to be an approximation of the standard.
Some features and behaviors are either not possible, not possible yet,
or changed because of the vastly different tech stack and Compact language constraints.

**Notable changes**

- **Uint<128> tokenIds** - Since 256-bit unsigned integers are not supported, the library uses the Compact type `Uint<128>`.
- **No _baseURI() support** - Native strings and string operations are not supported within the Compact language, so concatenating a base URI + token ID is not possible like in other NFT implementations. Therefore, we propose the URI storage approach; whereby, NFTs may or may not have unique "base" URIs. It's up to the implementation to decide on how to handle this.

**Features and specifications NOT supported**

- **Events** - Midnight does not currently support events, but this is planned on being supported in the future.
- **Uint256 type** - There's ongoing research on ways to support uint256 in the future.
- **Interface** - Compact currently does not have a way to define a contract interface.
This library offers modules of contracts with free floating circuits;
nevertheless, there are no means of enforcing that all circuits are provided.
- **ERC-165 Standard** - Since Compact doesn't provide a way to define a contract interace,
it's not possible to implement an https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165] like interface standard at this time.
- **Safe Transfers** - It's not possible to implement safe transfers without an https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165] like
interface standard at this time.

== Contract-to-contract calls

Contract-to-contract calls are currently not supported in the Compact language.
Due to this limitation, the current iteration of NonFungibleToken disallows transfers and mints to the `ContractAddress` type.
Transferring tokens to a contract may result in those tokens being locked forever.
The NonFungibleToken module, however, does provide `unsafe` circuit variants for users who wish to experiment with sending tokens to contracts.

WARNING: The `unsafe` circuits will eventually be deprecated after Compact supports contract-to-contract callsâ€”meaning
`_transfer`, `_mint`, etc. are planned to eventually allow the recipients to be of the `ContractAddress` type.

== Usage

:extensibility-pattern: xref:extensibility.adoc#the_module_contract_pattern[Module/Contract Pattern]
:nonfungible-mint: xref:/api/nonFungibleToken.adoc#NonFungibleTokenModule-_mint[_mint]

Import the NonFungibleToken module into the implementing contract.
It's recommended to prefix the module with `NonFungibleToken_` to avoid circuit signature clashes.

```typescript
pragma language_version >= 0.17.0;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/token/NonFungibleToken"
  prefix NonFungibleToken_;

constructor(
  name: Opaque<"string">,
  symbol: Opaque<"string">,
) {
  NonFungibleToken_initialize(name, symbol);
}
```

Next, expose the ciruits that users may call in the contract.
This library enables extensibility by following the rules of the {extensibility-pattern}.
Note that circuits with a preceding underscore (`_likeThis`) are meant to be building blocks for implementing contracts.
Exposing {nonfungible-mint} without some sort of access control, for example, would allow ANYONE to mint tokens.

```typescript
export circuit name(): Opaque<"string"> {
  return NonFungibleToken_name();
}

export circuit symbol(): Opaque<"string"> {
  return NonFungibleToken_symbol();
}

(...)
```

The following example is a simple non-fungible token contract that mints an NFT to the passed recipient upon construction.

```typescript
// SimpleNonFungibleToken.compact

pragma language_version >= 0.17.0;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/token/NonFungibleToken"
  prefix NonFungibleToken_;

constructor(
  name: Opaque<"string">,
  symbol: Opaque<"string">,
  recipient: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>,
  tokenURI: Opaque<"string">,
) {
  const tokenId = 1 as Uint<128>;
  NonFungibleToken_initialize(name, symbol);
  NonFungibleToken__mint(recipient, tokenId);
  NonFungibleToken__setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI);
}

export circuit balanceOf(
  owner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
): Uint<128> {
  return NonFungibleToken_balanceOf(owner);
}

export circuit ownerOf(
  tokenId: Uint<128>,
): Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress> {
  return NonFungibleToken_ownerOf(tokenId);
}

export circuit name(): Opaque<"string"> {
  return NonFungibleToken_name();
}

export circuit symbol(): Opaque<"string"> {
  return NonFungibleToken_symbol();
}

export circuit tokenURI(tokenId: Uint<128>): Opaque<"string"> {
  return NonFungibleToken_tokenURI(tokenId);
}

export circuit approve(
  to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>,
  tokenId: Uint<128>,
): [] {
  NonFungibleToken_approve(to, tokenId);
}

export circuit getApproved(
  tokenId: Uint<128>,
): Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress> {
  return NonFungibleToken_getApproved(tokenId);
}

export circuit setApprovalForAll(
  operator: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>,
  approved: Boolean
): [] {
  NonFungibleToken_setApprovalForAll(operator, approved);
}

export circuit isApprovedForAll(
  owner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>,
  operator: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
): Boolean {
  return NonFungibleToken_isApprovedForAll(owner, operator);
}

export circuit transferFrom(
  from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>,
  to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
  tokenId: Uint<128>,
): [] {
  NonFungibleToken_transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
}
```
